# Component Guide

Basically, we are using [Native Base](https://nativebase.io/) components library.
So, if you want to use basic components such as `Button` or `Link`, please use [Native Base's components](https://nativebase.io/) .

If you want to customize Native Base's components, please check `theme.ts` first.
You can define default component's style by using theme feature.

But if you really need to add a customized component, add it here.
